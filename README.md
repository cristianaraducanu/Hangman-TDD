# Hangman-TDD

I made a simple Hangman game in Java programming language, using the Test Driven Development.
The game can be played in the command line.


Steps to play: just run the app and open the command line. The messages will guide you to easily have fun.

To change the words in the game, enter the HangmanTDD/src/main/java/Main.java file and just replace the words at line 5 with whatever words you want to put in your game.
